# Basic Neural Network Library

This is a very basic Java Neural Network library based on the one built by Daniel Shiffman in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) playlist using the [Efficient Java Matrix Library](https://www.ejml.org) (EJML).

## Features

- Neural Network with variable amounts of Inputs, hidden nodes and outputs
- Two layered (hidden + output)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) Build-Management
- [EJML](https://www.ejml.org) used for Matrix math

## Examples (Usages)

- [XOR solved with Basic Neural Network Library](https://github.com/kim-marcel/xor_with_nn)

## TODO

- Add support for multiple layers

## Download
